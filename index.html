      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dec 2024 - Present:</strong> iGEM 2025 Competition Team Member
      <p>As part of the University of Groningen's team for the iGEM 2025 competition, I contributed to the dry lab section by applying machine learning models to predict optimal guide RNAs for detecting antibiotic resistance traits using CRISPR-Cas13, integral to developing a novel diagnostic kit, "CRIKIT". We are furthermore working on developing a software that automizes the process of analysis of the fluorescence data to detect antibiotic resistance sequences.</p>
